# run_analysis
It is a coursera project work.

This repository is being created by Maneesh V. Sharma for the submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment Project . It contains the step by step procedures and also contains the instructions on how to run analysis on the said file- Human Activity recognition dataset.

Dataset Name : Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

File Name : code book.md - A Code Book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations and steps/ work which I had performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R contains the detailed step by step procedure and process  (along with the code) which I adopted to get the data which is NEAT, CLEAN AND TIDY. 
In order to achieve the required and the desired TIDY DATA I adopted the following two steps-
1. Preparation of Data by performing validated and the designated steps to check the validated datasets. 
    # LOADING THE LIBRARY 'dplyr'.
    # UNZIPPING THE DATA.
    # CHECKING IF ARCHIEVE ALREADY EXISTS. 
    # PREPARATION OF VARIABLES AND DATA SETS.
2. Five Steps required as described in the assignment project tasks-
    # Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    # Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    # Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    # Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    # From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and         each subject.
    
FINALDATA.TXT is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
